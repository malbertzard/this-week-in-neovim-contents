> tldr: Otter.nvim provides lsp features and a code completion source for code embedded in other documents

Otter.nvim has been released for more than a week but the author is currently promoting it a bit on reddit so thats why its mentoined here.

Introducing otter.nvim, the solution to harnessing the full power of language features in embedded code blocks!
When code is embedded as blocks within a document, it often lacks the comprehensive language support typically available for pure files. That's where otter.nvim comes to the rescue. This innovative plugin creates and synchronizes hidden buffers, called otter buffers, each dedicated to a single language.
By directing requests for code completion, documentation hover windows, and diagnostics from the main buffer to these otter buffers, otter.nvim ensures that you can enjoy all the cool language features you would typically have for a pure file. The plugin seamlessly integrates these language features into your editing experience, regardless of the context.
With otter.nvim, you no longer have to compromise on functionality when working with embedded code. It enables you to work efficiently and effectively, with all the assistance and insights provided by language servers and intelligent code analysis.
Experience the best of both worlds with otter.nvim. Unlock the full potential of your embedded code blocks and enjoy the same rich language features you would expect from working with pure files. Boost your productivity and code with confidence using otter.nvim.

This is can be used in other plugins as seen in: [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim).
