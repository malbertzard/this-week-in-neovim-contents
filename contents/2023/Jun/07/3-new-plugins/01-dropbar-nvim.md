Introducing `dropbar.nvim`, the new winbar plugin designed for neovimmers!
With `dropbar.nvim`, you can elevate your neovim experience to an IDE-like level. This standalone plugin offers support 
for various sources, including LSP (Language Server Protocol) and tree-sitter, enabling seamless integration with your 
coding workflow.

The plugin boasts a user-friendly interface with clickable items, allowing you to navigate through your code 
effortlessly. Not only can you use your mouse for interaction, but you can also leverage the keyboard in pick mode to
efficiently navigate the available options.

One of the standout features of `dropbar.nvim` is its hierarchical structure display. The drop-down menu presents a 
clear overview of the symbol hierarchy in your code, enabling quick navigation and understanding of the codebase.
Customizability is at the heart of `dropbar.nvim`. Tailor the appearance of the winbar and drop-down menu to your
liking, and fine-tune other aspects of the plugin's behavior. Additionally, you have the freedom to choose your 
preferred sources for the winbar or even create your own sources.

As `dropbar.nvim` is still in its early stages, your feedback is invaluable.
