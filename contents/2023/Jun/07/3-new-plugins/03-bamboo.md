bamboo.nvim is a Neovim colorscheme that is based on the popular onedark colorscheme.
As a fork, it inherits the foundational design and aesthetics of onedark while adding its own unique features and modifications.
The primary focus of bamboo.nvim is to provide a visually pleasing and eye-friendly experience.
It achieves this by reducing the usage of blue and purple colors to minimize eye strain, while emphasizing red, yellow, and green for better readability.
The comments are specifically styled to ensure good contrast with other text and the background, enhancing legibility.
Additionally, bamboo.nvim extends support to various plugins, carefully selecting appropriate colors to maintain consistency across different tools.
One of the notable aspects of bamboo.nvim is its customizability, allowing users to tweak colors, highlights, and code styles to suit their preferences. Overall, bamboo.nvim offers a modified take on the onedark colorscheme, delivering a visually comfortable and personalized coding environment in Neovim.
