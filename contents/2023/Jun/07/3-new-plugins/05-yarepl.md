Yarepl.nvim is a powerful and flexible REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) management plugin for Neovim.
It simplifies the process of interacting with a REPL and text buffer, making tasks such as sending and managing text and REPL buffers effortless.

Flexibility and parallelism are top priority.
With yarepl.nvim, you can easily interact with multiple REPLs using various paradigms, such as sending text from multiple buffers to a single REPL, sending text from a single buffer to multiple REPLs, and sending text to a specific type of REPL.
Plus, it offers native dot repeat functionality without requiring vim-repeat.
