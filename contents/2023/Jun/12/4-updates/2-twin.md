Even though TWiN has been a well-received community project, it has been running for a while without the amount of
expected contributions. There is a narrow core of regular contributors (opening a PR at least twice a month), but
overall, the traction is mostly read-only and occasional one-shot contributors not even respecting the most basic
formatting rules (you have no idea how many lines of HTML I have updated because people just let `your-plugin`
placeholders). All of that is a lot of effort taken from my spare-time.

We are getting pretty close to the one-year anniversary of TWiN and a question that has been around my head in the past
weeks is: this is the DNS renewal anniversary, too; should I renew it? And the answer is,
_on my side_ – phaazon – no. The reasons are numerous and probably already known by many, but TWiN was designed and
implemented by one person (me, phaazon) in order to become a community project, and it’s never reached that point.
Some people suggested that I should kill the project, which I’ve always refused to because I felt like I had to go
through the whole thing.

Turns out I’m tired of this weird read-only relationship I have with most of the readers. I don’t even really benefit
from it all anymore since I have fully migrated to Kakoune-based editors. It’s not your fault. It’s a systemic problem.
[It’s the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule).

So this little update is just there to let you know that, end of the month, the domain
name – _this-week-in-neovim.org_ – should be free again. If someone in the community wants to pick it up and redeploy
a version of TWiN – even my code –, I’m 100% okay with that. However, and that seems pretty obvious, if you do so,
remember that you’re using _my code_, which is licensed.

Feel free to reach to me if you are interested to make a seamless migration to the new IP address, whether you use my
code, or your own.

Cheers.
